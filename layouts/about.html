    <h1>About The Point Process</h1>
    <p style="font-size: 20px">
        Created in 2025, The Point Process was created in response to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_Enlightenment">Dark Enlightenment</a> (also known as the Neoreactionary movement, or NRx) and the current debacle of Trump's 2nd term.  In a series of essays, The Point Process attempts to defend two seemingly contradictory ideas: decentralization and democracy.  The goal of these essays is to provide clear and concise counterpoints to NRx, philosophically, empirically, and mathematically.  These essays will draw heavily from liberal and moral philosophers such as John Locke, David Hume, and John Rawls as well as some economists like Adam Smith and Thorstein Veblen.  Additional support for these essays primarily will come from research in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_choice_theory">social choice theory</a> and concepts from statistics, probability theory, and information theory (e.g., using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_large_numbers">law of large number</a> to support non-mathematical ideas such as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wisdom_of_the_crowd">wisdom of the crowd</a>).  These theories will also be used to show where modern democracies can be improved such as the latest research focused on combating <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gerrymandering">gerrymandering</a>, alternative voting methods that markedly improve on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First-past-the-post_voting">first-past-the-post</a>, and how an abstract theorem like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Condorcet's_jury_theorem">Condorcet's jury theorem</a> can inform public policy decisions (e.g., expanding public education to all).  Although The Point Process mainly focuses on issues within the United States, its ideas can be applied broadly outside of the States.

    <h2>Why "The Point Process"?</h2>
    <p style="font-size: 20px">
        The goal was to choose a name that would be mathematically suggestive as well as evoke the nature of essays in general.  In statistics and probability theory, a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point_process">point process</a> is a set of randomly located points in a mathematical space such as the real line, usually with regards to time.  As such, these essays will be written from time to time (though hopefully not too randomly) defending specific points.  The name is also descriptive: essay writing is the process of "making" a point.

    <h2>Author(s)?</h2>
    <p style="font-size: 20px">
        We hope to mitigate any bias in our writings as well as preserve our privacy by remaining anonymous, hence why we have chosen the moniker Publius2.0.  The name Publius is an ode to the authors of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Federalist_Papers">Federalist papers</a> who argued for the ratification of the Constitution of the United States, while 2.0 is a commonly used phrase in version control from software engineering meaning the second version or (more colloquially) the most updated version.  Like the name suggests, we are building on the work of those who came before us to improve the present for a better future.  Thus, as Isaac Newton once said, "If I have seen further [than others], it is by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standing_on_the_shoulders_of_giants">standing on the shoulders of giants</a>".
